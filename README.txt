The pokedex app holds two dependancies. These are:
Pandas
Kivy

The purpose of this app is to have a convientent way for me to track pokedex entries and pokemon. The current plan:
Just get the pokedex working on the raspberry pi.

Future Plans:
Maps for all the regions
Having pokemon show what route they are on in the regional maps
A move dex, showing their power, accuracy, special conditions, and flavor text

How to Download/Run:
Download Python from https://www.python.org/downloads/
Open a command terminal, and inside the command terminal, run following lines:
"pip install kivy"
"pip install pandas"
then right click on the inside the pokedex folder, and open a terminal
look to see if terminal says something like: "C:\****\****\****\****\pokedex>" (Please note that only the end part with pokedex matters.)
run "python3 Pokedex.py"

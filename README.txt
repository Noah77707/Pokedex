The pokedex app holds two dependancies. These are:
Pandas
Kivy

The purpose of this app is to have a convientent way for me to track pokedex entries and pokemon. The current plan:
Just get the pokedex working on the raspberry pi.

Future Plans:
A catch log
Maps for all the regions
Having pokemon show what route they are on in the regional maps
and whatever comes to mind later

v0.1: This was the creation of the pokedex app
v0.2: This was when I got it running on the Raspberry pi.
v0.3: This was when I got images working in the pokedex screen, along with making the screen nicer to look at for the raspberry pi's smaller screen
v0.4: Finished up the Kanto dex, starting work on Johto Dex

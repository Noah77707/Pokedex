The pokedex app holds two dependancies. These are:
Pandas
Kivy

The purpose of this app is to have a convientent way for me to track pokedex entries and pokemon. The current plan:
Just get the pokedex working on the raspberry pi.

Future Plans:
A catch log
Maps for all the regions
Having pokemon show what route they are on in the regional maps
and whatever comes to mind later
